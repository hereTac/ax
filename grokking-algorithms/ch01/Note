## Introduction to algorithms
* Binary search
* Big O notation
* Exercises
  * 1.3 O(log n)
  * 1.4 O(n)
  * 1.5 O(n)
  * 1.6 O(n)
* Recap
  * Binary search is a lot faster than simple search.
    * 二分查找的速度比简单查找快得多。
  * O(log n) is faster than O(n), but it gets a lot faster once the list of
items you’re searching through grows.
    * O  (log n )比O  (n  )快。需要搜索的元素越多，前者比后者就快得越多。
  * Algorithm speed isn’t measured in seconds.
    * 算法运行时间并不以秒为单位。
  * Algorithm times are measured in terms of growth of an algorithm.
    * 算法运行时间是从其增速的角度度量的
  * Algorithm times are written in Big O notation.
    * 算法运行时间用大O表示法表示。
